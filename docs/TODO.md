## Themes

- Start in whitebox room, talk to camera
  - transition in and out of this white room through demonstrations
  - demonstrations will not last more than 5 seconds
    
- The demonstrations
    - Start video as fullscreen, make some dialog on how can we expand on this platform, as the player gets smaller in transition
      - Zoom into character in video while video player shrinks, will give effect that the person is not moving
      - Use ambient background to start
    - Parody of showing off emoji and chat feed like I'm a popular influencer, transition out with entire screen glass cracking, and fading back into dialog
      - "Like omg, I love you guys so much!" - Cut
    - DJ laser show, popped collar stuff
      - Mic and hat tossed in off screen, pop collar, do a michael jackson move
        - Record in reverse , start in micheal jackson pose, mic in hand, hat on head, move back onto feet while tossing stuff off scree
        - Cut to some dumb quick zoom in/out stuff, laser show comes out drawn on background canvas
    - Live game data feed for esports
      - CSGO parody playing at desktop, show live feed of game kills
      - Use classic unreal tournament sound effects multi kill
      - Popoff moment
    - Falcon Punch energy drink ad
    - 

### Actor appearance dialogs

- information icon like on youtube video, it animates/highlights to draw someone's attention, but will no longer animate after usage
- It will display bio pic, character name, actor name

### Game Kill feed

- CSGO tournament C9 pro league final match, kill feed and board
- On victory animate background to stuff

### Twitch streamer emoji icon feed

- Steal a speedrun popoff moment, and emoji feed it.

### Transitions to different video feeds

- Will run multiple feeds
- animation transitions

### Canvas Player Event

Simple interface for preloading assets, playing animation commands on canvas

### Falcon Punch designs

Parody of a no longer existant meme 14 years ago, it's an energy drink called Falcon Punch "Enough vitamin C and anti oxidants to blow your god damn head off" then Ness' head explodes

### Laser show assets

Might be too drab

### Emoji/chat react feed

I wear a wig in selfie mode and say "Like omg, I love you guys so much!"

### Video Player movement and control

command to change the players aspect ratio on container box, and on video element itself.

### Ambient Canvas background

Steal this https://amazon-ivs-ambiance.glitch.me/ https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ivs-basic-web-sample/blob/master/ambiance-canvas/script.js

### Broken Glass effect and transition

svg/canvas overlay of entire screen, glass breaks, falls off the screen in pieces to white background, video transitions back in

### CSGO Kill feed and score
